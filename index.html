      <!-- About Me Description -->
      <p class="about-text">
        I am a passionate and dedicated B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with 
        a strong interest in software development, problem-solving, and building innovative tech solutions.
        I am actively developing my skills in programming, data structures & algorithms, 
        web development, and system design to pursue a career as a Software Engineer.
        My core strengths include a solid foundation in Java, C/C++, Python, and 
        JavaScript, along with hands-on experience in projects involving HTML, CSS, 
        React, Node.js, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I enjoy learning new 
        technologies and am always curious about how systems work under the hood.
        I aim to join a dynamic tech company where I can contribute meaningfully to 
        real-world products while growing as a full-stack developer or backend engineer. 
        Currently, I'm focused on mastering DSA, contributing to open-source projects, 
        and preparing for tech interviews.

      <h3>Simon Says Game</h3>
      <p>Simon Says is a memory-based color sequence game. The game generates 
        a random sequence of colors (like red, green, blue, yellow), and the 
        player must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. 
        Each round adds a new color to the sequence, and the game continues until
         the player makes a mistake.

      <h3>BMI Calculator</h3>
      <p>A BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator helps users determine whether their
         body weight is healthy based on their height and weight. The user enters 
         their weight (in kg) and height (in cm), and the calculator uses JavaScript
          to compute the BMI using the formula:
